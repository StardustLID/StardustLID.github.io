Biography
======
I am a Ph.D. student in the Systems Control Group under the Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, the University of Toronto, supervised by Prof. [Margaret P. Chapman](https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~mchapman/). I received my BEng degree in Computer Science and in Electronic Engineering, and BBA degree in General Business Management, under the [Dual Degree Program in Technology and Management](https://techmgmt.hkust.edu.hk/), from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2024.

My undergraduate Final Year Thesis was supervised by Prof. [Ling Shi](https://eesling.home.ece.ust.hk/). I was also very fortunate to have worked as a research assistant to Prof. [Qiu Li](https://eeqiu.people.ust.hk/) in a research project on Phase Theory.
