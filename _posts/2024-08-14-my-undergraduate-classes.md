There are a lot to say about my very, very fruitful undergraduate studies. Let's start with the classes I took.

I took 23-28 credits[^1] in each regular (Fall or Spring) semester, except in Year 1 (when I wasn't allowed to overload too much). I diversified my COMP, ELEC, MATH, business and common core classes throughout the years. The complete list of courses is below:

[^1]: One course is typically 3 credits, and the normative load is 15-18 credits per semester.

(*Note:* 0-credit and/or non-letter-graded courses (e.g. seminars) are not listed.)
